Tip 036: See submodule status of any branch without checking out to it

This is helpful when you want to know what some other branch has a particular
submodule checked out to.

git ls-tree <branch> <submodule>

It's nice, cause you don't have to checkout that branch or git submodule update
to know what state the master repo's branch is referencing.
