Tip 021: Git blame -- Who did that?

Git blame sounds like an "active" command, you might think that when you
git blame something another developer is going to get a nasty email. 
Well that would be totally badass, but it's not true, it's completely passive.

Do you need to know who last modified a file, or a line in that file?

   git blame <file>

... will show you the last person who modified each line in a file and 
the time it was modified.
