Tip 031: git grep for tab characters

You may be familiar with grepping for tab characters, like so:

   grep -P '\t'

But since git grep doesn't support the -P switch, how do you do it
using git?

Insert a literal tab into the command by typing Ctrl+v right before
you hit tab, like so

git grep <CTRL+v>'<TAB>'

Sweet.  Now you can get rid of all those tabs.  Seriously, get rid of 
them.
