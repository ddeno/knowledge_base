Tip 017: git 'rm' -- what's that do?

'git rm' is simple, but if you don't understand the index it kind of feels
out of place.

When you 'git rm' a file, you are telling git "I no longer want this file
to show up in my working tree, I'm done using it".  However, this DOES NOT
mean the file is lost forever, it will still exist with all it's history
in the repo.

Not confused?  Well you're right it's not that difficult, it's just weird
that 'git add' and 'git rm' both add something to the index.  The naming
could use improvement in my opinion.

If you just 'rm file' then it will show up as a deleted file not staged for
commit, you still have to 'git rm file' for it to show up in the index. Even
though you might think you can 'git add' the deleted file, that won't do 
anything.
