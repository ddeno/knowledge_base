Tip 042: Git stash untracked files

With git 1.7.7+, you can stash all files including files that aren't tracked.
That is nice because a lot of times you have added files and junk and you just
want to totally stash your directory and not drag the created clutter with you.
Here's the command:

% git stash -u

Also, "git reset --hard HEAD" doesn't clean up files that aren't tracked.  If
you have untracked files, they hang around.  To get rid of those you can "git
clean".  Here is my alias:

% alias gnuke 'git reset --hard HEAD; git clean -df'

That, actually, isn't all the way nuked, you could add the -x option to 
also clean gitignored files... but that was too nuclear for me... as I need
some of my ignored files... however, say if you had your  *.o  etc. files
ignored... the -x option would clean up those too.
