Tip 016: Use 'git mv' to rename and move files

Git is like the government, it's always watching you so that you can remain
safe and oppressed.  I just made myself sad.

And like the government, sometimes it get's confused when you move around and
put your money in an offshore account.  OK, enough with this metaphor.

When you need to rename or move a tracked file in a git repo, use 'git mv' so
git knows what you are doing.  If you just 'mv' the file, git may get confused
and think it's a completely new file.  If you 'git mv' all the history associated
with that file will remain, even though it has a new name or location.
