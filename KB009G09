Lesson 009: Git diff and git difftool

Git diff lets you diff files across commits and branches in order to show
you explicitly what has changed for entire files or directories.

git diff <commit hash 1> <commit hash 2> -- file

Looking at diff output is for suckers.  Use git difftool to speed things up.
Put an entry in your ~/.gitconfig that looks like this....

   [diff]
       tool = gvimdiff

You can make the tool whatever non-vim tool you are comfortable with, you know,
if that's what you are into...

Now if you have some changes between your working tree and the index (or last commit
if your index is empty) do this...

   git difftool

and you handy diff tool of choice will come up and show you everthing that is
different side by side. If you want to view changes between what's in the index
and what the last commit had, do 

   git difftool --cached

git difftool will still accept all the normal arguments of git diff, so you could
compare a file between two commits like so...

   git difftool df7fc411777f7b5547e908b1c74cf6405a9047c3 e52abf8a890ec8ca641fa784a1b02706178851f1 -- myfile.c

Pretty badass right?  Wait til you discover git mergetool !
