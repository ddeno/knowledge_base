Tip 022: Show commits for a particular developer

Need to see all the commits made from one person? Do this...

git log --author="Author Name"

If you are not sure the exact spelling of the author, you can
always grep through the log, like so...

git log |grep "John Smith"
git log |grep -i "Jonathan Smith"
