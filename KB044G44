Tip 044: Think you lost a commit? Git reflog (pronouced REFF LOG, not RE-flog)

Check out the description in the man page for git-reflog:

    git-reflog – Manage reflog information

Well, that's useful.  Here's one that I wrote, that says essentially the same thing:

    git-reflog – Get info for stuff about things

It turns out, there's a better definition later in the man page, it looks like this...

    Reflog is a mechanism to record when the tip of branches are updated. This
    command is to manage the information recorded in it.

Simply put, the reflog is how git tracks what actions you perform in your repo over
a period of time.  By default, it keeps this information for 30 days.  If you think
you may have lost a commit somewhere, you probably haven't.  It's in your git reflog!
At least, it will be for 30 days.  If you find a lost commit in the git reflog, you
can checkout to it, cherry-pick, merge or whatever you want.  After 30 days, it may
automatically be cleaned up by git.
