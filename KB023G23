Tip 023: Upstream and Downstream

You may hear the terms upstream and downstream in your normal water cooler 
git conversation in between star wars quotes and battlestar galactica references.

If it's not immediately clear, I will define them now by using a stupid analogy.

Imagine everyones git repo is like one massive river that flows slowly. You are
floating along on a kayak which is positioned at your last commit. Look behind
you, there's a whole bunch of commits in that river.  They are "downstream" from
you. Your buddy pulled from you earlier today and has made 3 commits since then.
You can see him ahead, on his cruise ship three commits "upstream".  He thinks
he's so cool.
