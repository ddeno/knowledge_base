Lesson 007: .git/ and Bare Repositories

How git works is practically indistinguishable from magic, but we do know a few
things.

Everything in your repo from it's inception to right now is stored in the top 
level under a folder .git/ .  When you checkout, commit, rebase, etc. git is retrieving
and or modifying the history of your project, all stored under this folder.

Remember, the files you see normally (the files you work with every day) are called
files in the working tree.  They can be deleted/manipulated but always be recovered, 
that's because they are being recovered from the .git/ folder.

You may be familiar with bare git repositories, usually they are cloned that way...
   git clone --bare /path/to/repo

If you look inside a bare repository, you'll notice theres no working tree, just
the .git/ files.  Bare repositories are usually used as centralized "mothership" repos
or "conveinence pushers" because bare repos can always be pushed to.  More about 'git push'
later...
