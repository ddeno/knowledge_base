Tip 038: Git with it, subvert Subversion!

Git is a complex & powerful tool.  It's a tool that demands it's users to have
a basic level of understanding to operate.  Some people say that's a reason to hate
git, but I disagree.  Would you rather chop down a tree with an axe, or learn how
to use a chainsaw?  If you like pain, You could try to chop the tree down with a 
Gillette Fusion shaving apparatus. Razor anyone?

Here's a few reasons why git is superior to subversion:

1. Branching is easy in subversion, but merging is a pain. Subversion has no
   history-aware merge capability forcing its users to manually track exactly which 
   revisions have been merged between branches making it error-prone
2. Subversion has no way to push changes to another user without submitting to the 
   central server.  Git excels at peer-to-peer collaboration.
3. Subversion fails to merge changes when files or directories are renamed
4. (.svn) files pollute your local directories
5. Offline commits are not possible with Subversion.
6. Git's distributed architecture creates a natural security against data loss
7. Subversion got in a fight with Git after school, it tried to take it's lunch
   money.  But git was all like, no way bro.  Then they played kickball.
