Tip 035: View deleted files (or modified in any way)

Here's a common scenario.  You pull from someone and find that a file you 
expected to exist no longer exists.  Someone deleted it!  How do you find
out what happened to that file?  Normally, you'd 'git blame file' to see
who modified it, but if it's gone, 'git blame' will fail like so:

fatal: cannot stat path : No such file or directory

What you want to do, is find it in the git log.  Luckily, 'git log' has the
following switch:

      --diff-filter=[ACDMRTUXB*]
           Select only files that are Added (A), Copied (C), Deleted (D),
           Modified (M), Renamed (R), have their type (i.e. regular file, symlink,
           submodule, ...) changed (T), are Unmerged (U), are Unknown (X), or have had
           their pairing Broken (B). Any combination of the filter characters may be used.
           When * (All-or-none) is added to the combination, all paths are selected if
           there is any file that matches other criteria in the comparison; if there is no
           file that matches other criteria, nothing is selected.


So in our example, lets show only deleted files...

    git log --diff-filter=D --summary

Jackpot.
