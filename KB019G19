Tip 019: Permanently Delete a File from all Git History

There's only a few occasions where you would ever want to permanently delete a file
from your git repo.  Here's a couple...

  1. You accidentally typed a password in a file, and somehow committed it
  2. You have been tracking files you never wanted in the first place, like
     autogenerated code or data files, etc.
  3. Someone rick rolled you by 'git add Rick_Astley_Never_Going...."

In practice you should probably never EVER do this, but I just give you the gun, I
don't tell you where to point it.

git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch path/to/file' HEAD
