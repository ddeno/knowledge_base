Tip 020: Blow away all uncommitted work.

This will delete all uncommitted work, meaning everything in the
"Changed but not updated" section will go back to their state at
the last commit (HEAD).

   git reset --hard HEAD

This is particularly useful when you've done some work and for one
reason or another you have decided to scrap everything you've done
and start over from the last commit.

It's also useful if you get halfway through a merge and realize for 
one reason or another that you want to abort the merge.

This will NOT delete untracked files.  If you want to do that, you
want to 'git clean -df'
