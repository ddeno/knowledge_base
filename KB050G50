Tip 050: git over NFS

I did some reading over the weekend about git over NFS.  Every time you do a
git status or checkin it does an lstat on every file in your git repo. 

1.  git config core.preloadindex true  - This tells git to not to wait for each
lstat to return before starting the next one.  There is a max number of threads
variable that is set to keep it from being over greedy.

2.  git "command" -uno - adding the dash uno tells it not to look for untracked files which
reduces the number lstats commands by it no longer needing them to do the lstat
on the directories and sub directories them selves. 

3.  putting code in sub modules and setting the sub module to ignore = dirty.  
these tells your git commands to not check this sub module for changed files.  

4.  Avoid large flat directory structures.   There is a lock that prevents the threaded 
lstats from returning in the same directory.  So it will serialize the threads in large
flat directories.
