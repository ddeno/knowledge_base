Tip 043: git checkout shortcuts

Next time you are bored, try this in your git repo. I'm assuming your typical branch 
name is master...

    git checkout master@{"yesterday"}

You're repo checks out to the state of master as it was known yesterday.
Wow, that's pretty badass.  All of the following formats will work the same way...

    git checkout master@{"5 minutes ago"} # where master was located 5 minutes ago
    git checkout master@{14:30}           # where master was located at 2:30
    git checkout master@{1}               # previous position of master
    git checkout master@{"last week"}     # where master was last week
    git checkout master@{"last monday"}     # where master was last Monday

Guess what, this works on git log too!

    git log --since="1 month ago"
    git log --since="yesterday"
    git log --since="last vernal equinox"
