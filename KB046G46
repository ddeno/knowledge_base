Tip 046: git revert

You may find that you make a commit for a change that you later decide you don't want.
You can revert your git repo using 'git revert'.  It's not a typical revert as defined
by other SCM tools because the revert itself is a commit.  This means you can always
return to the "bad state" but you have permanently stored a record of the reversion of
that commit.

git revert SHA-HASH    <-- this is the commit has you want to REMOVE
