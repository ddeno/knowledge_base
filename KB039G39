Tip 039: Having issues collaborating? Check your umask

If you have trouble collaborating with other users's repos, there may be a
permission problem.  The problem shows up when a commit is made by a user with
a "bad" umask, and objects are written to .git/ that have no group/other read
permissions.  The original developer may not be aware of the problem until someone
else attempts to pull or run "git log" in their area.

I've seen everything from "corrupted object" to "not a git repo" when this happens. 
Set your umask to 022 in your bashrc (or cshrc) to make sure is correct no matter what 
machine you are working on.

If you have a git repo that's all messed up because of a bad umask, I'm sorry, you 
will have to re-clone and start over.  LAWL! just kidding.  Just do this in your ./git
directory...

   chmod -R go+r *

... and you should be good to go.
