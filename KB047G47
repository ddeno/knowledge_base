Tip 047: Undo git fetch

This is kind of a weird functionality someone might need, but be clear that this
is not the same as undoing a git-merge or undoing a git-pull.

Let's take an example workflow...

    git show origin/master # shows commit abc123
    
    git fetch              # yay i got something!
    
    git show origin/master # shows commit def456

    mystery command goes here so that...
    
    git show origin/master # shows commit abc123


Here's how you do it 
    git update-ref refs/remotes/origin/master refs/remotes/origin/master@{1}
