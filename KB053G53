Tip 053: Fetch a stash from remote repo

Let's say a co-worker stashed off some debug prints or something.  Basically,
they did some work that has temporary usefulness but doesn't warrant a commit,
so they stashed it off.  If you go to that remote repo, assuming you have filesystem
access, you can do 'git log stash@{#}' to get the commit hash associated with 
that stash, let's call it <abcdefg> for the purposes of this example. Remember,
to see all stashes do 'git stash list'.

You can fetch this stash locally, so that you can access the contents of it
by putting it into a temporary branch.  cd to your git repo, and do this:

git send-pack ./ <abcdefg>:refs/heads/tempbranch

Make sure the remote you are trying to fetch from is actually set up as a
remote in your repo, and that you 'git fetch' before trying this.
