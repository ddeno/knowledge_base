Tip 037: The difference between ~ (tilde) and ^ (caret)

HEAD~ is shorthand for HEAD~1 and means the head's commit's first parent. HEAD~2 means
the commit's first parent's first parent. HEAD~3 means the commit's first
parent's first parent's first parent. And so on.

HEAD^ is shorthand for HEAD^1 and means the commit's first parent. But where
the two differ is that HEAD^2 means the commit's second parent (remember,
commits can have two parents when they are a merge).

The ^ and ~ operators can be combined.  Using 'git show' will illustrate the reference
without affecting the repo -- try these.  These are all valid references to a
state of the repository...

    git show HEAD^~
    git show HEAD~^
    git show HEAD~5
    git show HEAD^^^~~
    git show <branch>^~^^^~~^^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^

Try this one
    git show HEAD^2

If HEAD only has one parent, you will see this error:
fatal: ambiguous argument 'HEAD^2': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.

So to summarize, use ~ to refernce first parental relationships, and ^ to reference 
second parent relationships.

Use :( to reference mother-in-law relationships.
