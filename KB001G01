Lesson 001: Git Terminology

---- Repository ----  
  A git repository contains the full history, the different versions over time
  and all different branches. In Git each copy of the repository is a
  complete repository. The repository allows you to retrieve any previous 
  state of development from current back to the first creation of the
  repository.  Your repository is complete, and no different than the
  repository it cloned from.  This concept is important and is something
  that makes git stand out when compared to centralized tools.

---- Branches  ----
  A branch is a separate code line with its own history. You can
  create a new branch from an existing one and change the code independently from
  other branches. One of the branches is the default (normally named master). The
  user selects a branch and works in this selected branch, which is called the
  "working copy". Selecting a branch is called "checkout a branch".  Branching
  allows the developer to easily pursue separate development paths without requiring
  them to manually keep track of which changes belong to which development concept.

--- Commit ---
  You commit your changes into a repository. This creates a new revision
  which can be retrieved later, for example if you want to see the source code of
  an older version. Each commit contains the author and committer, thus making it
  possible to identify the source of the change. The author and committer might
  be different people.

  Those coming from a centralized approach to source code management may be tempted
  to equate "committing code" with "checking in code".  Since git is not centralized,
  when you commit it IS ONLY AFFECTING YOUR REPOSITORY. Don't be afraid to commit.
