Lesson 003: Your first repository

Take a couple minutes to make your first git repo.  It will
be easy, just follow along as I read the instructions aloud...

  #Switch to home
  cd ~/

  # Create a directory
  mkdir ~/repo01

  # Switch into it
  cd repo01

  # Create a new directory
  mkdir datafiles

  # Create a few files
  touch test01
  touch test02
  touch test03
  touch datafiles/data.txt

  # Put a little text into the first file
  ls >test01

  # Initialize the local Git repository
  git init

  # Look at your repo status
  git status

  # Add all (files and directories) to the Git repository
  git add .

  # Make a commit of your file to the local repository
  git commit -m "Initial commit"

  # Show the log file
  git log

Change one of your files, then do another 'git status'. Try 'git diff' as well.
