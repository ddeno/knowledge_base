Tip 012: Git colors are fun

Put this in your ~/.gitconfig to get some wicked hardcore colors

[color]
        ui = true

Now everytime you do a git status, git log, blah blah you'll see helpful
colors.  In git status, green entries represent stuff ready to commit
red entries are outstanding things the developer should look at, like
untracked files, changed but not updated, etc.
