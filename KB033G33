Tip 033: Add a new remote

You may not be aware that origin/branch is just one of many possible
remotes your repo could have.  This is particularly useful if you are
an integrator for your team.  In other words, if you are the one pulling
peer-to-peer often from the same developers, you may want to set their
repo up as another remote.  Try it!

    git remote add <yourNameForRemote> <URL>
ex: git remote add bob /users/bob/dev/repo

Now, you can do 'git fetch bob' and bob's changes will be fetched in to your 
repo (REMEMBER: FETCHED not PULLED).  You can even look at exactly what bob has
in his last commit, by checking out to it, like so

   git checkout bob/branch

Just like origin, you can merge directly with bob's remote:

   git checkout dev
   git merge bob/dev

Enjoy!
